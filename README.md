# Security Management System

## Overall

The **Security Management System** is a robust web-based platform designed to streamline and secure the management of campus security operations. It offers a centralized interface for administrators and security staff to handle gate monitoring, emergency event tracking, and log management. The system emphasizes secure authentication, role-based access control, and scalable architecture.

## Master Branch (Blazor WebAssembly App)

1. Built using **Blazor WebAssembly** (.NET).
2. Login system for both Security Staff and Admins with JWT-based authentication.
3. Role-based access control (e.g., only "Computer Security Officer" can trigger emergency events).
4. Dynamic dropdowns for selecting campus and gate to filter and manage security logs.
5. Responsive UI for managing campuses, gates, logs, and security personnel.

## Backend API Branch (ASP.NET Core Web API)

1. Developed using **ASP.NET Core Web API**.
2. Structured using layered architecture: Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository.
3. Entity Framework Core for database access and migrations.
4. Supports all core operations: CRUD for staff, campus, gates, and logs.
5. JWT token generation and validation using Microsoft Identity libraries.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages:
1. **C#** (.NET for frontend and backend)
2. **HTML/CSS** (Blazor components)

### Frameworks & Libraries:
1. **Blazor WebAssembly** â€“ For the client-side application.
2. **ASP.NET Core Web API** â€“ Backend RESTful services.
